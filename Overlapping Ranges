/* You will be given an array with 5 numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, 
 * and the next two numbers represent another range. The final number in the array is X.
 * The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least X numbers.
 * For example, in the array [4, 10, 2, 6, 3] the ranges 4 to 10 and 2 to 6 overlap by at least 
 * 3 numbers (4, 5, 6), so your program should return true.
