Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

Examples:

findNb(1071225) --> 45
findNb(91716553919377) --> -1
*/

// input - volume of the building
// output - no of cubes to  construct the building such that volume of the building = n ^ 3 + (n - 1) ^ 3 + ... + 1 ^ 3
// process - initiate a loop until the sum < volume of the building. Calculate sum as sum + n ^ 3, where n = 1 at the beginning, and increment n by 1 in the loop

function findNoOfCubes(volume) {
  var n = 0;
  var sum = 0;
  while (sum < volume) {
    sum += Math.pow(++n, 3); 
  }
  return sum === volume ? n : -1;
}
