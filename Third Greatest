*  Using the JavaScript language, have the function ThirdGreatest(strArr) take the     
*  array of strings stored in strArr and return the third largest word within in.      
*  So for example: if strArr is ["hello", "world", "before", "all"] your output should 
*  be world because "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5,    
*  but the output should be world because it appeared as the last 5 letter word in     
*  the array. If strArr was ["hello", "world", "after", "all"] the output should be    
*  after because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so return the last one. 
*  The array will have at least three strings and each string will only contain        
*  letters.
